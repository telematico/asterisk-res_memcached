                                      ;   will persist forever. (note that memcached does NOT store its database on 
                                      ;   a non-volatile support, so the entries will be lost anyway when the 
                                      ;   memcached server goes down.) the ttl value can be overridden in the dialplan 
                                      ;   by the MCDTTL dialplan variable.
;binary_proto=yes                     ; using binary protocol for conversation with server; default is yes. note that 
                                      ;   the MCDCOUNTER() function is not happy if the protocol is not binary
hash=default                          ; hashing mode (see libmemcached documentation); accepted values are default
                                      ;   (which is actually md5), md5, crc, fnv1_64, fnv1_64a, fnv1_32, fnv1_32a,

                                      ;   or stored, so that you can create some sort of a "domain" for your

                                      ;   the default memcached port is 11211. if no entries, the module will at

;;;;;;;;;;;;;  UGLY NOTE ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; apparently, creating a memcached connection pool in libmemcached 1.0.4 fails 
; when the parameters --BINARY-PROTOCOL and --HASH= are submitted. therefore 
; we cannot select the binary protocol, and as such the MCDCOUNTER() functions 
; fail. hopefully i will find a workaround soon, or libmemcached 1.0 will be 
; fixed. but for now i had no other choice than ignoring the binary_proto= and 
; the hash= parameters.
